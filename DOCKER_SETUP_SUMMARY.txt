FHE Artifact Docker Setup - Summary
================================================================================

CLEANUP COMPLETED
-----------------
✓ Docker container stopped and removed
✓ Docker image removed
✓ Temporary build logs cleaned (/tmp/docker_build*.log)
✓ Dangling Docker images removed
✓ Unused patch files removed

EVALUATION SCRIPTS CREATED
---------------------------
1. test_docker_quick.sh
   - Quick sanity check (30-50 minutes)
   - Builds image and runs basic tests
   - Verifies all three implementations work

2. run_docker_evaluation.sh
   - Automated evaluation with result collection
   - Usage: ./run_docker_evaluation.sh [quick|full]
   - Saves results to timestamped directory

3. verify_environment.sh
   - Environment verification script (run inside container)

4. run_quick_tests.sh
   - Quick tests inside container

5. run_full_benchmarks.sh
   - Full benchmark suite inside container

6. build_all.sh
   - Utility script for building all implementations

DOCUMENTATION CREATED
----------------------
1. DOCKER.md (updated)
   - Comprehensive Docker usage guide
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Resource requirements

2. EVALUATION_GUIDE.md (new)
   - Step-by-step evaluation instructions
   - What to verify
   - Expected results
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. Inline SUMMARY.md
   - Automatically generated with each evaluation run
   - Explains result files and performance metrics

KEY FILES FOR DOCKER BUILD
---------------------------
1. Dockerfile
   - Multi-stage Docker build
   - Installs OpenFHE and HElib
   - Pre-builds all implementations

2. docker-compose.yml
   - Docker Compose configuration
   - Resource limits
   - Volume mounts

3. .dockerignore
   - Excludes unnecessary files from build context

4. Ctxt_patched.h
   - Pre-patched HElib header with custom methods
   - Contains multiplyModByP2R() and divideModByP()
   - Essential for encoding switching

MODIFIED FILES
--------------
1. scheme_switching/CMakeLists.txt
   - Removed unnecessary Google Benchmark dependency
   - Line ~60: Removed target_link_libraries(workload benchmark)

2. ARTIFACT-APPENDIX.md (minor updates)
3. README.md (minor updates)

HOW TO USE
----------
For quick evaluation:
  ./test_docker_quick.sh

For comprehensive evaluation:
  ./run_docker_evaluation.sh quick

For full benchmarks:
  ./run_docker_evaluation.sh full

Results are saved to: results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
----------------------
The evaluation scripts verify:
✓ All three implementations build successfully
✓ TFHE produces timing results for workloads
✓ Scheme switching executes correctly
✓ Encoding switching uses custom HElib methods
✓ Performance trends match paper claims

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Review EVALUATION_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions
2. Run ./test_docker_quick.sh to verify everything works
3. Examine results and compare with paper claims
4. For full evaluation, run ./run_docker_evaluation.sh full

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
- First Docker build takes 30-90 minutes
- Requires 16GB+ RAM, 50GB+ disk space
- Quick tests take 10-20 minutes after build
- Full benchmarks can take several hours
- All tests run in isolated Docker environment
- No changes to host system

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
If issues occur:
1. Check DOCKER.md for detailed troubleshooting
2. Verify Docker resources (memory, disk space)
3. Check logs: docker-compose logs fhe-artifact
4. See EVALUATION_GUIDE.md for common issues

CLEANUP
-------
To remove everything:
  docker-compose down
  docker rmi fhe-artifact:latest
  docker system prune -a
